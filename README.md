- Zwift Play

### Supported Platforms
- Android

### How does it work?
The app connects to your Zwift device automatically. 

- When using Android a "click" on a certain part of the screen is simulated to trigger the action.
- When using macOS or Windows a keyboard click is used to trigger the action. Typically + and - keys are used to shift gears, while MyWhoosh uses K and I keys.

### TODO
- test Zwift Ride
- implement more actions for Play + Ride
- shorebird?
